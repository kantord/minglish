"""Static scan for one garden-path shape in the Tier-1 grammar (2026-09-06):
"X COMMA X" — two constituents of the same syntactic category joined only
by a comma, with no conjunction between them. This is the exact structural
signature behind the Appositive's confirmed garden path (docs/garden-paths-2026-09-06.md):
a reader cannot tell "an aside" from "an asyndetic list" until much later
material (often the predicate's agreement) resolves it, if anything does.

Not a general ambiguity checker — LALRPOP's own build already proves the
grammar has zero *formal* ambiguity. This looks for a specific *human*
garden-path shape a formally-unambiguous grammar can still contain, as a
candidate list for a human/agent reading test before shipping, not a final
verdict — severity still needs the same empirical check this file's own
history used (see docs/garden-paths-2026-09-06.md).

Usage: python3 scripts/garden-path-scan.py [crates/grammar/src/minglish.lalrpop]
