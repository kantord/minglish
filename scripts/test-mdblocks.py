"""Regression test for scripts/mdblocks.py against
tests/markdown-cases/kitchen-sink.md — one example of every markdown
feature the module handles (docs/markdown-linting.md). Run by
./scripts/check.sh; exits nonzero on any failure.

Asserts three things, not just "it doesn't crash":
1. Every construct in the file lands in the block kind it should
   (structure), and excluded constructs (code/table/hr/frontmatter/HTML/
   footnote-definition) leave no trace in any other block's text (no
   leakage — this is exactly the class of bug the file was built to catch).
2. The real minglish sentences the file deliberately includes still parse
   clean through the actual grammar/linter, not just get classified right —
   a structural fix that broke the underlying sentence would pass part 1
   and fail here.
3. The known-not-minglish content (the guide/diagram/chart words, "Bold"
   opening a sentence, the non-colon nested list) is correctly rejected,
   with a real reason — proves the linter still runs on this content, it
   doesn't just silently pass everything.
