"""Document-level lint (measurement only, never gating) for any markdown
file — not only this project's own ADR-shaped docs (docs/markdown-linting.md
has the block-classification and heading rules).

For a markdown file: per-sentence verdicts and parse rate; a heading check
(vocabulary-only — headings are titles, not sentences: see
docs/markdown-linting.md); topic continuity (does the subject noun of each
sentence appear in the sentence before it?); and a relation inventory —
English coherence connectives in the source, grouped by relation type,
marked by whether minglish has a form for them.

Usage: lint-file.py FILE.md [--brief]   (brief: no per-sentence listing)
