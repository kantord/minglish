# Finding frequency — real-usage signal for which antiparsers to build next

Not a coverage target (see docs/STATUS.md, "EWT triage numbers are telemetry, not targets"); this measures which *rejection explanations* fire, not how much of English parses.

## Near-miss minglish (tests/paragraph-cases + tests/agent-cases)

Real repair-attempt proposals/outputs — the higher-relevance source — 6643 sentences.

### Outcomes

- Clean: 2528 (38.1%)
- Style: 1336 (20.1%)

### STYLE finding kinds, ranked (quoted words normalized to `X`)

- 480 — X — a singular noun needs a determiner: X (mass nouns take X)
  example: the declarations list contains the words i and you and my and your
- 473 — X — a clause cannot be the object of a verb; state the fact in its own sentence, or name it: X
  example: a note describes the allowed words
- 273 — X — noun-noun compounds are not minglish; write X, or one transparent word (ADR 0015)
  example: the system does not have an anaphora mechanism
- 121 — X is a defined term — write X (see CONTEXT.md)
  example: the system does not have plans for an anaphora or a discourse layer
- 114 — this is an inline list — write an Enumeration block: a statement ending in X whose last noun phrase is plural or counted, then one X per line (ADR 0028)
  example: the allowed words include i, you, my, and your
- 108 — X is transitive in minglish and needs an object
  example: the system does not have plans for an anaphora or a discourse layer

  example: the declarations list contains the words i and you and my and your
- 76 — X is a verb in minglish and cannot follow a determiner
  example: Minglish is the name of the language

- 23 — X is a verb form in minglish and cannot follow a determiner — name the thing with a noun
  example: the agent needs a discourse layer for the finding of the referent of the anaphora

  example: the agent needs a discourse layer for the finding of the referent of the anaphora
- 6 — X — a word mentioned as a word must be quoted: Xa\X (ADR 0018)
  example: A rule can force a text longer than the standard
