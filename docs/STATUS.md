# Project status and handoff

Last updated: 2026-09-05 (`just finding-frequency` — real-usage
instrumentation of `diagnose()` outcomes over 6643 near-miss minglish
sentences from `tests/paragraph-cases/` + `tests/agent-cases/`. Ranks
STYLE finding kinds so the antiparser backlog (docs/ideas.md,
"Antiparsers") gets built off real frequency, not guesses. The ranking
immediately caught a real bug, not just a coverage gap: the #2 finding,
"a clause cannot be the object of a verb" (473×, 7% of all near-miss
sentences), was ~98.5% false positives — the old token-window heuristic
("two verb-ish tokens, no connective") misfired on ordinary predicates
(do-support negation, modal + verb, copula + passive participle — each
is exactly two verb-ish tokens with nothing between them). Replaced
with a 4th antiparser, `AntiClauseObject`
(crates/antiparse/src/anti_clause_object.lalrpop): requires a real
subject-like NP wedged between the two verbs, the actual structural
signal a second clause has started — a token-window guess can never
tell that from an aux/modal/copula next to its own main verb. Bucket
dropped 473 → 7 genuine matches on rerun. Report: docs/finding-
frequency-report.md; full writeup in docs/ideas.md, "Antiparsers".
Determiner-omission (480×, now top of the ranking) is next, but needs
its own audit first — see docs/ideas.md's "Still not done". Fixed along
the way: adding a crate's second `[[bin]]` target silently broke every
`cargo run -p diagnose` call site that didn't pin `--bin diagnose`
(showcase.sh, lint-file.py, dogfood-sweep.py, justfile's `lint`) —
`|| true` swallowed the ambiguous-target error and truncated
docs/showcase.md to nothing. On 2026-09-04,
`crates/antiparse` was wired into `diagnose()` as a fourth channel,
ahead of the generic fallback — when the hand-written
`pattern_findings`/`slot_findings` checks find nothing, an antiparser
match is tried, ranked by proximity to Tier-1's real failure position
(new: `grammar::parse_tokens` / `failure_position`). Confirmed
genuine, not just infrastructure: "the mechanism only stores the
report" (ADR 0047's free-`only` ban, no prior dedicated check) now
gets a specific `[AntiFreeOnly]` explanation with both candidate fixes
named, instead of the generic message. See docs/ideas.md,
"Antiparsers", for the full writeup). Everything a fresh agent needs
that is not derivable from the code, ADRs, or git history.

## Where everything lives

- `domain/model.json` — the domain model (ADR 0027): every project term with
  its minglish definition; `CONTEXT.md` is generated from it. Noun terms are
  written Capitalized in minglish text. `just define <Term>` looks one up.
  ADR 0036 schema: every noun term has `kind` ("unique" | "category"), a
  category needs `examples` (an example ending in "." is a minglish
  sentence and is self-linted; a multi-line one is a Block), `member_of`
  names its parent category. These fields live only in the model, never in
  the seed; a core lemma that becomes a term is dropped from the seed
  (done for "pronoun" and "block").
- `docs/adr/0001–0049` — every language and policy decision, each citing its
  evidence. 0006 (comprehension-first + density + expressiveness-subordinate
  + enforcement hierarchy), 0008 (redirect vs ban) as amended by 0023
  (per-sense synonyms, absolute findability floor), 0012 (loss taxonomy),
  0015 (transparency-first vocabulary) are the governing ones.
- `docs/research/cnl-design-findings.md` — empirical findings, including five
  documented cases where a metric was optimized at the cost of meaning or
  quality; read the relevant entries before treating any metric as a target.
- `tests/dogfood-cases/` — the standard dogfood flow (README there) and open
  gap cases. `tests/agent-cases/` — LLM repair snapshots with human verdicts.
- `justfile` — check / showcase / lint / agenttest / autofix /
  autofix-paragraphs (paragraph repair flow, `tests/paragraph-cases/`) targets.
- `docs/review-checklist.md` — known failure types to check in every
  evaluation. `docs/language-gaps.md` — ranked tally of missing words and
  constructions from the 2026-09-03 full-corpus naturalness rewrite;
  clause-level "but" (ADR 0037), coordination inside a causal/conditional
  clause (ADR 0038), "without" (ADR 0039), and coordinated noun phrases
  (ADR 0040 banned the bare form on a documented LALR finding; ADR 0041
  reopened it behind a colon, "the mechanism stores: a word and a
  message", which sidesteps the conflict entirely) are resolved. What is
  left is single missing words ("only", "other"), not constructions.
- `docs/prejudge.md` / `just prejudge` — blind sub-agent pre-judgement of
  paragraph repairs (naturalness score; telephone game: explain-then-rate
  fidelity) recorded under `prejudge:` in each case, docs/prejudge-report.md.
  Runs on Claude Code sub-agents, so it costs no API key; it filters and
  flags, the human verdict stays `just verdict`.
- `scripts/lint-file.py` / `just lint-file <md>` — document-level lint,
  works on any markdown file (2026-09-03): per-sentence verdicts, a
  heading check (vocabulary-only, not the sentence grammar), topic
  continuity, relation inventory. Shared markdown structural parsing lives
  in `scripts/mdblocks.py` (code fences, tables, blockquotes, links,
  nested/task lists, headings) — see `docs/markdown-linting.md` for the
  block-classification and heading rules and why. `just coherence`
  regenerates `docs/coherence-report.md` over all ADRs.

## Open decision queue (in order, with standing recommendations)

1. **Coherence relations beyond cause** (exemplification, sequence,
   concession, purpose, elaboration) and cross-sentence relations: decide
   from `docs/coherence-report.md` (relation inventory + topic continuity,
   `just coherence`), not from word counts. Next: the paragraph repair flow
   (agreed design in docs/ideas.md, "Paragraph repair").
2. Parked with design notes in `docs/ideas.md`: vocative (directed
   imperatives), quotation-as-mention, pseudocode/analysis-code compiler,
   embeddings-as-measurement, core+jargon-packs split, LM-based cost model.
3. Structured repair (docs/ideas.md, "Structured repair"): structure
   enumerator → role assignment → table-driven rewrite with explanations;
   NLI as the future faithfulness gate. Steps 1–3 need no model and no API
   spend; the first candidate for build work after the vocabulary queue.
4. Deferred by ADR 0022 (numbers, decided 2026-09-01): measurement values
   ("the exit code is 0" — the natural home for a future 0), ordinals,
   units, thousands separators, decimals. Needs a value slot distinct from
   the NUM_PL count slot.
5. Deferred by ADR 0023 (same): the named-standard form "identical to the
   report" needs an adjective + PP complement the copula lacks.
6. Deferred by ADR 0024 (percent): percent of a singular mass, percentages as
   predicates, decimals. Ambitransitives ("the process stops") remain a
   findings-level gap with no case attached; commit-as-verb (adr0001-05) was
   resolved by the linter's own redirect (*save*).

## Working process (session-established, not in any ADR)

- Language decisions go through a grilling interview (options + recommendation,
  user decides), then land as: tentative ADR + seed/grammar change + corpus
  sentences + reject tests + regenerated reports, all in one commit.
- `./scripts/check.sh` must pass before commits; it regenerates everything
  and drift-checks committed artifacts. It includes the self-lint tests:
  every example sentence in the skill, in linter advice, and in ban advice
  must itself parse — never feed the model an invalid example.
- The user runs all `git commit`s and all API-spending runs (agenttest,
  autofix) themselves; those runs are milestones, not routine.
- Between milestones, `just replay` is the proxy: it re-validates every
  stored paragraph proposal (tests/paragraph-cases/) against the current
  linter, no API. A linter change should raise valid counts and lower the
  no-advice count; a language change that lowers them needs a reason.
- Every review of linter output, rewrites, or agent snapshots goes through
  `docs/review-checklist.md` (known failure types; append, never delete).
- Dogfood flow: lint own docs → useful flag → rewrite in place (English
  quality first — parse-validity is NEVER the rewrite target; well-written
  but unparseable = gap evidence) → else file gap case.

## Metrics snapshot (2026-09-01)

- Lexicon 652 forms incl. 24 Capitalized term nouns (ADR 0027); corpus 70/70
  parse; grammar LR(1)-clean, zero
  precedence declarations (CI-enforced).
- agenttest first-try trajectory: 44 → 51 → 48 → 52 of 54 (run 5). Predictions registered for run 6: "please delete the file" should
  snapshot to the bare imperative (skill now teaches it); the no-must case
  should stop dropping the deontic (advice got a concrete example);
  autofix rerun on ADR 0001 should yield real proposals + GAP declarations
  (extractor fixed, refusal-routing strengthened).
- Naturalness pass (2026-09-03): every ADR (0001–0036) and the domain
  model were rewritten by blind sub-agents for naturalness, judged by
  independent naturalness/telephone-fidelity/imaginability judges before
  and after (docs/judge-report.md, docs/judgements.yaml,
  scripts/docjudge.py, `just judge-docs`). Naturalness mean rose from
  3.2 to 3.7 corpus-wide; every document still fully parses (100%,
  docs/dogfood-sweep.md) and lints clean. docs/language-gaps.md records
  what blocked further improvement.
- ADR sweep: every ADR (0001–0028) is fully minglish since 2026-09-02
  (docs/dogfood-sweep.md; docs/dogfood-adr-00NN.md per ADR). 0002 was rewritten
  by hand after nine paragraph-repair runs; 0005 after one cold run; the other
  26 with no model run (lint-file + fix-gap-or-follow-advice). The problem
  archetypes met are logged in docs/rewrite-archetypes.md for the batch review.
- Property-based tests (2026-09-03): `proptest` is a dev-dependency of
  `grammar`, `diagnose`, and `lexgen` — crash-freedom fuzzing on `tokenize`/
  `units`/`parse`/`diagnose`/morph.rs, plus a lexicon-driven generator in
  `crates/diagnose/tests/proptest_generated.rs` asserting every generated
  `Statement`/`Coordination` sentence parses and Tier-2 stays a superset of
  Tier-1. Full survey and what's not yet built in docs/ideas.md,
  "Property-based testing with proptest".
- Lexicon ≈1770 forms, ≈95 domain terms; `just replay` is the no-LLM proxy.
  `scripts/seedcheck.py` pre-flights a batch of new lemmas (unattested forms,
  cross-POS waivers) so one lexgen run succeeds; its auto-waivers are noted
  `[auto-waived …]` and belong to the batch review. Expected: ADRs are meta-linguistic
  register, and coverage of them is a non-target (see the reframe in
  docs/dogfood-adr-0001.md: coverage of arbitrary English is a non-goal).
- Dogfood ADR 0001: every sentence parses (in-place rewrite, 15 declared
  pairs in corpus/dogfood-pairs.tsv); cost ratio in docs/dogfood-cost-report.md
  (understated by the nominalization blind spot — see findings).

## Standing policies easy to violate accidentally

- Epistemic hedges ("maybe", "probably", "likely", "seem", "might",
  "could", 13 words total, ADR 0042) are a permanent Ban, not a
  coverage gap — do not add one to close a vocabulary gap; the fix is
  always to state the claim directly or name the source.
- No references to (or derivation from) non-open controlled-language
  specifications anywhere in the repo — the anonymous policy note in
  docs/resources.md is deliberate; do not name them even to warn.
- CC BY-SA data (UD-EWT, wordfreq table) is fetched, never vendored
  (scripts/fetch-data.sh); tracked content stays MIT/Apache + permissive.
- The dogfood curation phase is our-own-jargon-first (docs/ideas.md,
  "Curation phasing"); EWT triage numbers are telemetry, not targets.
