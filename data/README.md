# Reference data

Used by `lexgen`/`triage` for **checking only** — never for choosing words
(see ADR 0001). Pinned by checksum in `checksums.sha256`; verify with
`sha256sum -c checksums.sha256` from this directory.

Permissively licensed files (WordNet, moby) are vendored in git. The
**CC BY-SA 4.0** files (`ud/`, `freq/`) are NOT vendored — run
`scripts/fetch-data.sh` once after cloning; it downloads/derives them from
pinned upstream versions and verifies these checksums, keeping the
repository itself entirely MIT/Apache.

The CC BY-SA file is data, kept separate from the project's code license; it
is only read to print frequency warnings in the lexicon report.

## Format notes

- WordNet index files: license header lines start with two spaces; data lines
  are `lemma pos synset_cnt ...` (space-separated, lemma uses `_` for spaces).
- mobypos: `word\CODES` per line (backslash separator), CRLF line endings.
  Codes: N noun, p plural, h noun phrase, V verb (participle), t transitive
  verb, i intransitive verb, A adjective, v adverb, C conjunction,
  P preposition, ! interjection, r pronoun, D/I articles, o nominative.
- en_zipf.tsv: `word\tzipf`, one header comment line.
